"""
Identifying graph problems - Visualizing the problem helps
1. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects, where objects are represented as nodes(vertices) and relationships as edges
2. Representation of relationship or connections - Relationship between entities, network topology, social networks.
3. Finding shortest paths or routes - Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. Dependency problems - task scheduling, course prerequisites - one task depends on the completion of the other - Topological sorting works here
5. Network flow problems - Maximum flow of water through a network of pipes - Ford-fulkerson
6. Component analysis - to analyze strongly connected or disconnected components within a network
7. Cyclic detection - Finding circular dependencies - Union-Find works here
8. Optimization problems - Prims, Kruskals, Travelling salesman - requires optimization on certain criteria
9. Territorial/Geographical mapping - maps, layout designs
10. Matching problems - matching elements of two sets - Job assignment, stable marriage problems *********
